# Creating New GitHub Repository for Full-Stack Poker Ledger

Since you're creating a new repository, here's the streamlined process:

## Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the green "New" button
3. Repository name: `poker-ledger-fullstack` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: "Full-stack poker settlement app with React frontend and FastAPI backend"
5. Keep it Public (for portfolio)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we'll push our own)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

In your terminal, from the project root:

```bash
cd "/Users/smadhan/Downloads/Poker Ledger Settler 2"

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Full-stack poker ledger with authentication and multi-game support"

# Add your remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/poker-ledger-fullstack.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Structure

Your repository should have this structure:
```
poker-ledger-fullstack/
├── poker-ledger-backend/        # FastAPI backend
│   ├── app/
│   ├── alembic/
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── vercel.json
├── poker-ledger-settler/        # React frontend  
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
├── UPDATE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
├── BACKEND_CONCEPTS_SIMPLE.md
└── README.md (if you want to add one)
```

## Step 4: Add a README (Optional but Recommended)

Create a `README.md` in the root:

```markdown
